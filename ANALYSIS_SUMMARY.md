## 🔄 How It Works (High Level)

### Payment Flow (Currently Broken)
```
1. Creator installs app in their Whop community ✅
2. Community member clicks app ✅
3. Whop shows payment page (€10) ✅
4. User pays via Whop ✅
5. Whop sends webhook to /api/webhooks/whop ✅ (route exists)
6. Webhook handler marks user as paid ❌ (not implemented)
7. User's has_paid status checked on next visit ⚠️ (table missing)
8. User gets access to app ❌ (can't reach this step)
```

### Video Upload Flow (Working)
```
1. User fills form (title + Mux URL) ✅
2. User clicks "Upload" ✅
3. Mux URL validated ✅
4. Video saved to Supabase ✅
5. Shareable ID generated (UUID) ✅
6. Success message shown ✅
7. User gets shareable link ✅ (but can't view video)
8. Others visit link → Video plays ❌ (no player)
```

### User Authentication (Working)
```
1. App embedded in Whop community ✅
2. Whop injects JWT token in header ✅
3. App reads token ✅
4. User info extracted ✅
5. Access status checked ✅
```

## 🎓 Key Learning: What is a Whop App?

A **Whop App** is not just any web app - it's specifically designed to:

1. **Run inside Whop communities** - Embedded as iframe
2. **Use Whop authentication** - No login forms needed
3. **Accept Whop payments** - Users pay via Whop
4. **Integrate with webhooks** - Real-time payment notifications
5. **Be multi-tenant** - Same app in multiple communities

**Key Advantages:**
- Zero authentication complexity (Whop handles it)
- Built-in payment processing (Whop SDK)
- Distribution via Whop App Store (access to creators)
- User context provided automatically

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Parse JWT tokens to identify users
- Handle webhooks to record payments
- Track payment status in your database
- Verify webhook signatures for security

---

## 💰 Revenue Model

**Pricing:** €10 one-time per user  
**Payout:** 80% to you, 20% to Whop

**Example Scenario:**
```
Creator A has 100 community members
50 members purchase your app
Revenue = 50 × €10 = €500
Your take = 80% = €400
Whop's take = 20% = €100
```

---

## 🔐 Security Analysis

### What's Good ✅
- Environment variables for secrets
- Backend verification of access
- No secrets in frontend code
- HTTPS via Vercel (enforced)
- Type-safe database queries (Supabase SDK)

### What's Missing ⚠️
- JWT signature verification (currently decoded only)
- Webhook signature verification (not checked)
- CORS configuration (not explicit)
- Rate limiting (not implemented)
- Input validation (minimal)
- Error logging (not setup)

### Vulnerabilities to Fix
1. **Critical:** Implement webhook signature verification
2. **Critical:** Implement JWT signature verification
3. **High:** Add rate limiting to API routes
4. **High:** Add comprehensive input validation
5. **Medium:** Setup error tracking (Sentry)

---

## 📊 Database Design

### Current Tables

**videos** - 10 columns
- id, user_id, shareable_id, title, description
- s3_url (unused), mux_url, duration (unused), thumbnail (unused)
- view_count, download_count, is_public
- created_at, updated_at

**video_accesses** - 6 columns
- id, video_id (FK), user_id, access_type, accessed_at, ip_address

### Missing Tables

**users** - Critical for payment tracking
- id, whop_user_id (from JWT), email, username, avatar
- **has_paid** (the key column!), payment_date

### Design Notes
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ Foreign keys for referential integrity
- ✅ Timestamps for audit trail
- ⚠️ RLS policies not configured
- ⚠️ No partition strategy for scale

## ✨ Key Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture** - MVVM pattern makes code organized
2. **Type Safe** - Full TypeScript coverage
3. **Modern Tech Stack** - Latest frameworks and libraries
4. **Well Documented** - Good inline comments
5. **Deployment Ready** - Vercel setup complete
6. **Database Solid** - Good schema design

---

## ⚠️ Key Risks

1. **Payment System Incomplete** - Critical blocker
2. **No Video Playback** - Core feature missing
3. **Limited Security** - JWT not fully verified
4. **No Monitoring** - Can't detect issues in production
5. **Manual Mux Extraction** - Fragile user experience
6. **No Video Storage** - Mux URLs may expire

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes Whop Different
- **Built-in distribution** - Your marketplace is Whop App Store
- **Trusted payments** - Whop handles fraud, compliance, support
- **Zero auth hassle** - Users already logged into Whop
- **Multi-tenant by design** - Multiple communities in one app

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Webhook reliability** - If webhooks fail, users can't pay
2. **User experience** - Smooth payment flow is essential
3. **Performance** - Video playback must be fast
4. **Reliability** - 99.9% uptime expected
5. **Support** - Users expect help if something breaks

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. ❌ Don't rely on Mux URLs forever (they expire)
2. ❌ Don't skip JWT verification (security hole)
3. ❌ Don't ignore webhook failures (payment loses)
4. ❌ Don't deploy without error tracking (blind to issues)
5. ❌ Don't forget multi-tenant context (wrong scope bugs)
