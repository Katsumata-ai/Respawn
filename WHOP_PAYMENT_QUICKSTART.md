## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Local Development
- [ ] ngrok running (`ngrok http 3000`)
- [ ] Dev server running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Webhook secret in `.env.local`
- [ ] Test webhook sent and received
- [ ] See "Payment processed successfully" in terminal

### Production
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Webhook secret in Vercel env vars
- [ ] Webhook URL updated to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/whop`
- [ ] Test webhook sent to production
- [ ] See success in `vercel logs`

### Database
- [ ] User appears in Supabase `users` table
- [ ] `has_paid = true` after webhook
- [ ] `/api/whop/validate-access` returns `hasAccess: true`

---

## üêõ If Something Goes Wrong

### Test Event Not Received
```bash
1. Verify ngrok URL in webhook config
2. Check ngrok is still running (terminal should show activity)
3. Check dev server terminal for errors
4. Try sending test event again
```

### "Invalid Webhook Signature" Error
```bash
1. Go to Whop dashboard webhook
2. Copy the secret again (make sure it's correct)
3. Update .env.local or Vercel env vars
4. Restart dev server (or redeploy if prod)
5. Try again
```

### User Not Marked as Paid
```bash
1. Check Supabase dashboard -> users table
2. Look for a user with recent payment_date
3. If not there: webhook didn't process
   ‚Üí Check webhook logs
   ‚Üí Check for errors in terminal
4. If there but has_paid=false: webhook partially processed
   ‚Üí Check database update error
```

### Can't Reach localhost:3000 with ngrok
```bash
1. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Stop ngrok (Ctrl+C)
3. Restart both:
   Terminal 1: ngrok http 3000
   Terminal 2: npm run dev
4. Get new ngrok URL and update Whop webhook
```

## üîë Key URLs to Remember

```
Local Dev:
- App: http://localhost:3000
- Webhook endpoint: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/whop
- Whop dashboard: https://whop.com/dashboard/developer

Production:
- App: https://your-app.vercel.app
- Webhook endpoint: https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/whop
- Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Vercel logs: vercel logs your-project-name
```

## üìä Payment Flow (What Happens)

```
1. User pays ‚Ç¨10 in Whop community
   ‚Üì
2. Whop sends webhook to /api/webhooks/whop
   ‚Üì
3. Your app verifies webhook signature
   ‚Üì
4. Creates or updates user in Supabase
   ‚Üì
5. Sets has_paid = true
   ‚Üì
6. Next time user visits app
   ‚Üì
7. /api/whop/validate-access checks has_paid
   ‚Üì
8. User gets access ‚úÖ
```

---

## üéØ AFTER SETUP: TEST PAYMENT FLOW

```bash
# 1. Local or production doesn't matter
# 2. Send test webhook from Whop dashboard
# 3. Check database
# 4. Verify access works
# 5. Test /api/whop/validate-access endpoint

# Test the access endpoint:
curl -H "x-whop-user-token: YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/whop/validate-access

# Response should be:
# {"hasAccess": true, "accessLevel": "customer"}
```

---

## üìù TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS

```bash
# Check if ngrok is running
ps aux | grep ngrok

# Check .env.local has webhook secret
cat .env.local | grep WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET

# Check Vercel env vars
vercel env ls

# View live logs
vercel logs your-project --follow

# View production deployment
vercel ls

# Test Supabase connection
# Go to Supabase dashboard and run query:
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## üö® COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Webhook not received" | Check ngrok URL in Whop dashboard |
| "Invalid signature" | Copy webhook secret again, update .env.local |
| "User not in database" | Check webhook actually sent, check Supabase |
| "Access still denied" | Verify has_paid = true, restart app |
| "ngrok URL keeps changing" | Ngrok expired, restart and update webhook URL |
| "env var not loading" | Restart dev server after updating .env.local |
| "Deploy failed" | Check build errors with `vercel logs` |

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIMING

```
Local setup: 15 minutes
Production setup: 15 minutes
Total: 30 minutes

If you've done it before: 10 minutes
