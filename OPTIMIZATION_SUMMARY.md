# 🚀 App Optimization Summary

## ✅ WHAT'S BEEN OPTIMIZED

### 1. **Fixed Hydration Mismatch**
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` and `<body>` tags
- Prevents errors from browser extensions modifying HTML
- Error was: `bis_skin_checked`, `__processed_f93a8dd7`, `bis_register` attributes

### 2. **Whop SDK Integration**
- ✅ Created `lib/whop/server.ts` - Server-side Whop operations
- ✅ Updated `lib/whop/client.ts` - Client-side Whop operations
- ✅ Implemented JWT token verification
- ✅ Implemented user access checking

### 3. **API Routes (Whop-Compliant)**
- ✅ `GET /api/whop/user` - Get current user from Whop context
- ✅ `GET /api/whop/validate-access` - Check if user paid €10
- ✅ `POST /api/webhooks/whop` - Handle payment webhooks

### 4. **Payment Webhook Handling**
- ✅ `payment.completed` - Mark user as paid
- ✅ `payment.refunded` - Handle refunds
- ✅ `user.removed` - Clean up when user leaves

### 5. **Database Integration**
- ✅ User creation/update on first login
- ✅ Payment status tracking
- ✅ Access level management (admin/customer/no_access)

### 6. **Removed AWS Dependency**
- ✅ Using Supabase Storage instead of AWS S3
