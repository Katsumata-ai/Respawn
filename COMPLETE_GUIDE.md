- ✅ Provides user context
- ✅ Sends webhooks for events
- ✅ No need for custom auth

### Why Next.js?
- ✅ Full-stack framework

## 🔑 KEY COMPONENTS

### 1. Frontend (React 19)
```
app/page.tsx - Main page
├─ Loads user from Whop context
├─ Checks payment status
├─ Shows video extractor
└─ Displays dashboard
```

### 2. Backend (Next.js API Routes)
```
app/api/
├─ whop/user - Get current user
├─ whop/validate-access - Check payment
├─ webhooks/whop - Handle payments
└─ videos/ - Video CRUD operations
```

### 3. Database (Supabase)
```
users table
├─ whop_user_id (unique)
├─ email
├─ has_paid (boolean)
└─ payment_date

videos table
├─ user_id (foreign key)
├─ title
├─ mux_url
├─ s3_url (Supabase Storage)
└─ view_count, download_count

video_accesses table
├─ video_id (foreign key)
├─ user_id
├─ access_type (view/download)
└─ accessed_at
```

### 4. Services (lib/whop/)
```
client.ts - Browser-side operations
├─ getCurrentUser()
├─ validateAccess()
└─ isAdmin()

server.ts - Server-side operations
├─ verifyWhopToken()
├─ checkUserAccess()
├─ markUserAsPaid()
└─ upsertUser()
```

## 🔐 SECURITY FLOW

```
1. User visits app in Whop community
   ↓
2. Whop passes JWT token in x-whop-user-token header
   ↓
3. App verifies token signature
   ↓
4. App checks if user has paid (has_paid = true)
   ↓
5. If paid: Show app
   If not paid: Show "Purchase required"
   ↓
6. When user pays: Webhook received
   ↓
7. App marks user as paid in database
   ↓
8. User gets access on next login
```

---

## 💰 PAYMENT FLOW

```
1. User clicks "Add App" in Whop community
   ↓
2. Whop shows payment screen (€10)
   ↓
3. User completes payment
   ↓
4. Whop sends payment.completed webhook
   ↓
5. App receives webhook at /api/webhooks/whop
   ↓
6. App marks user as paid in database
   ↓
7. User gets access to app
```
